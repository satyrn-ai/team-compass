## Why zensical?

We use zensical since it works well with Markdown and builds upon the successful mkdocs material project.
It has extensive documentation as well as flexibility.
It performs well as a website and documentation.
It's mobile responsive out of the box.

## Why pixi

Pixi performs well for cross platform package management and task management. It is used in many Scientific Python projects where GPU support and different operating systems (Windows, Linux, Mac) are required.

uv, pip and conda should all also work. For the docs build, the only needed dependency is `zensical`.
